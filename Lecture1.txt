Data -> Collection of raw bytes.

Raw data is meaningless, we need to PROCESS them.

eg. 

12.2    36      29.11
14      26      25.55   => Raw Data

Height  Weight  BMI
12.2     36     29.11
14       26     25.55   => Processed Data

Processed Data is also called 'Information'.
Data when Processed gives us a context the ability to make decisions.
