Data -> Collection of raw bytes.

Raw data is meaningless, we need to PROCESS them.

eg. 

12.2    36      29.11
14      26      25.55   => Raw Data

Height  Weight  BMI
12.2     36     29.11
14       26     25.55   => Processed Data

Processed Data is also called 'Information'.
Data when Processed gives us a context the ability to make decisions.

Types of data:
• Qualitative - Descriptive (Non Numerical) form
• Quantitative - Numerical form

A processor processes data and turns it into information.

Taking Feedback is an important way to collect data.

Database - It is a place where data can be easily stored, accessed from, updated and managed.

DBMS - Database Management System -: 

• It is a set of programs which access the data and a collection of interrelated data.

• It is used to store and receive database information in an efficient way.

• It does the following set of programs to manage data:
addition, updation, deletion and accessing of data.

• DBMS - Database + Software + Functionality

Earlier File Systems were used which were not that efficient for data accessing.

• Data Redundancy - Keeping the same data in 2 or more places in a database

DBMS advantages / File System Disadvantages:

• Data Redundancy and Inconsistancy
• Difficulty in Accessing Data 
• Data Isolation (Same Data stored in different forms (formats like .txt, .pdf, .svg etc) hence it is difficult to retrieve them.). 
• Integrity Problems - (Having Consistency Constraints i.e. changing the limit constraints for different data files). 
• Atomic Problems (Atomic - An event will either happen or not happen, i.e either 0 or 1, not something in between that)
eg. Atomic Action - Debit Money from my account -> Credit money to someone else's account

Debit money from my account and not credit to someone else's account is an Atomic Problem. This is taken care of in DBMS. 

• Concurrent Access Anomalies - eg. 2 people taking out the money from the same account at the same time.

• Security Problems - eg. Keeping Some info private and confidential and keep some information public and open to all.
