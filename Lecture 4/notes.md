## Extended ER Features

1. Specialization
    - This has a 'is - a' relationship
    (see page 1,2,3 of slides).
    This is somewhat similar to Inheritance.
    - Depicted by *triangle* component.

    Divide attributes, apply specialization, make the ER model simpler.

    This is a *top-down* approach. ↓

    This is used to eliminate redundancy.

    Def - Specialization is a way of splitting an entity set into further sub entity sets, on the basis of their functionalities, specialities and features.

    eg, a person entity set (superclass) can be divided into customer, student and employee (subclasses)

    We can now show special and distinctive features of the sub-entities.
    (see egs in slides pg 4-6)

2. Generalization
    - This is a *bottom-up* approach. ↑
    - This is also an *is-a* relation.
    - This is reverse of specialization.


**While using specialization and generalization, we inherit attributes too (i.e. child class inherits attributes of parent class).**

**Participation Inheritance - If a parent entity participates in a relationship, then the child will also participate in that relationship.**

3. Aggregation

Normal ER Diagram Problem (see eg on slides pg 7)

Aggregation shows relationship among relationships.
